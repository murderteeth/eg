lets create a new component called "Chains"

- it should either be or be similar to the HoverCard x HoverCardTrigger combo

- the text of the main button shows a list of selected chain from the chains list

- default selected is mainnet

- the hovercard has a list of chains to select

- each item has a chain icon and the chain name

- clicking an item toggles the select state of the chain

- to show chain icon, check out the ycms project and look for how it uses a function to get cdn urls for token icons. those are for tokens not chains, but the same source supports chain icons if you format the url accordingly

-------------------------------------------------
- the hover card doesn't need any header or footer, just show chains

- for some reason there's more gap between the hover trigger and the card creating a mouseover deadzone between them where the component looses hover and the card disapears. this doesn't happen in the other hover card demo fwiw. but in this case i have to move the mouse cursor really fast into the card to keep it open. MUST FIX

-------------------------------------------------
now there's no gap though? that doesn't look good, keep the original gap. but fix the problem in the chains component that's causing the *extra* gap and deadzone

-------------------------------------------------
- lets keep the width of the trigger constant

- it's ok to have no chain selected. the trigger say "Select a chain.."

- when more than one chain is selected, lets just show chain icons for each chain in a horizontal list. let them overlap by 40% so they appear stacked

-------------------------------------------------
- get rid of the "n chains" text

- make the icons twice as big

- dont show the check mark on each selected item, its redundant

- dont change an item's bg color when it's selected

- but when an item is clicked, it should use the same active state standard buttons do (it gets brighter i think)

- make trigger wider by ~30%

-------------------------------------------------
- make the icons in the card bigger too 

- make the text bigger too

- for selected chains, show a medium sized dot to the far right of the list item, make it color of active state

- there's still some top and bottom padding in the card, 86


-------------------------------------------------
- when only one or no items are selected, left justify the trigger's text

- when only one item is slected, show more gap between icon and text in trigger

- add gap between icon and text in card too

- the trigger's border is 0 i think? give it same border as Button

-------------------------------------------------
- make the hover trigger's hover bg color the same as standard Button, not black

-------------------------------------------------
"when only one or no items are selected, left justify the trigger's text"

this hasn't been done yet i think. when onlyl ethereum is selected it looks centered

-------------------------------------------------
- add a Button that's laid out to right of the trigger

- it has the same dot in it that shows on a selected card item

- it toggles all chains sleected if no chains selected, and no chains slected if any chains are slected

- its a part of the chains component, not separate

-------------------------------------------------
- if no chains are selected, the dot in the toggle is invisible

- if any chains are selected, the dot is visible

- the toggle button has a bit too much x padding

-------------------------------------------------
- look in ../kalani/packages/web/src/components/motion

- port in the motion components and their deps

-------------------------------------------------
- lets left justify everything in the trigger actually, not just when less than 2 chains are selected

- add a FlyInFromBottom animation around the dot in the select all toggle

- add FlyInFromBottom animations to the chain icons as they appear in the trigger

-------------------------------------------------
- the chain icons in trigger no longer overlap

-------------------------------------------------
- make sure ethereum is the default state, but allow no chains to be slected

-------------------------------------------------
- when all chains are selected, show a little text above the top left of the trigger that says "All chains"

- its absolute positioned

- it's in italics

- it has a fire icon, <PiFireSimpleFill />, from react-icons to the left

-------------------------------------------------
- wrap it with FlyInFromBottom too

- give it some left margin or padding

-------------------------------------------------
- for the list item icons, lets try sth different

- check out ../cms/packages/app/src/components/ToggleChains

- when the item is hovered lets zoom the icon like in cms app, and clip it with a bounding area that is square

> status, everything is working great. change request. lets get rid of the toggle button entirely. but add the toggle functionality to
   the main hover trigger's onclick. so now we just have one button for everything

● I'll remove the toggle button and add the toggle all/none functionality to the main hover trigger's onClick event.

● Done! Removed the toggle button and added the toggle all/none functionality directly to the main hover trigger's onClick event.
  Now clicking the trigger button will toggle between selecting all chains and clearing all selections.

> hmm i can see that you added the toggle directly to the main hover trigger's onclick. but it's not working when i browser test. when
   i click the trigger button nothing happens

● Let me check the HoverCardTrigger component to see how it handles clicks.

● Read(src/components/HoverCard/index.tsx)
  ⎿  Read 60 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● I see the issue. The HoverCardTrigger component doesn't accept or pass through an onClick prop. It's just a presentational
  component that renders a div. We need to modify how we're adding the click handler. Let me fix this:

● Update(src/components/HoverCard/index.tsx)
  ⎿  Updated src/components/HoverCard/index.tsx with 2 additions and 2 removals                                            
       28      group-hover:text-primary-50
       29      `)
       30    
       31 -  export function HoverCardTrigger({ className, children }: { className?: string, children: ReactNode }) {
       32 -    return <div className={cn(triggerClassName, className)}>
       31 +  export function HoverCardTrigger({ className, children, onClick }: { className?: string, children: ReactNode, 
          +  onClick?: () => void }) {
       32 +    return <div className={cn(triggerClassName, className)} onClick={onClick}>
       33        <span className="transform skew-x-20">{children}</span>
       34      </div>
       35    }

● Now the HoverCardTrigger accepts an onClick prop and will handle the toggle functionality when clicked.

> make the cursor pointer too

● Update(src/components/HoverCard/index.tsx)
  ⎿  Updated src/components/HoverCard/index.tsx with 1 addition and 1 removal
       20      relative h-8 px-8 py-5
       21      flex items-center gap-2
       22      bg-secondary-800 text-secondary-300 text-2xl
       23 -    rounded-primary cursor-default
       23 +    rounded-primary cursor-pointer
       24      drop-shadow-4 drop-shadow-secondary-600/60
       25      transform -skew-x-20
       26    

● Done! Changed cursor from cursor-default to cursor-pointer to indicate the trigger is clickable.
